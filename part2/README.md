# Part 2

My solutions to part2 exercises, one app per folder, made by using React and Vite
- courseinfo: exercises 2.1.-2.5
- phonebook: exercises 2.6.-2.17

## Usage
1. Inside the directory of the app (courseinfo/phonebook/countries), run `npm install`
2. For courseinfo or countries, run `npm run dev`; for phonebook, run `npm run server`, then run in another terminal `npm run dev`
3. Access the web page with the URL shown in the terminal after running `npm run dev` command
