# Part 7

This part introduces

- React router: a useful library for managing navigation in a React app
- custom hooks: an option offered by React primarily to facilitate the reuse of the logic used in components
- styling with Bootstrap and Material UI in a React app
- Webpack: bundler used by Create React App
- Class components that were used in old React code: hook functionality that came with React version 16.8 makes it possible to define React components as JS functions; before that, defining a component using state relies on Class syntax of JS.
